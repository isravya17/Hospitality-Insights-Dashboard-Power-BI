## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

**Task List**

## Key Learnings of Dashboard Development
  - Explored the use of bookmarks and selection to enhance dashboard functionality, such as implementing page navigation and a clear filter button. 
  - Created a Calendar visual using the matrix table, enabling versatile analytical applications. 
  - Analyzed hotel cancellation policies and found that most hotels allow free cancellation if done at least three months in advance. Cancellations made later typically incur charges between 60% and 90% of the 
    booking cost.  
  - Applied a consistent color palette across the dashboard to maintain visual harmony and a professional look.
## Insights
  - AtliQ Exotica outperforms all seven property types, generating 320 Million in revenue with a rating of 3.62, an occupancy rate of 57%, and a cancellation rate of 24.4%.  
  - AtliQ Bay achieves the highest occupancy rate at 66%.  
  - Elite rooms are the most booked but also have the highest cancellation rate.  
  - Cancellations cost AtliQ approximately 298 Million in revenue.  
  - Mumbai generates the most revenue at 669 Million, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.  
  - Delhi leads in both occupancy and customer ratings, with Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore trailing closely.  
  - Week 24 stands out as the most profitable period, bringing in 139.6 Million in revenue.
